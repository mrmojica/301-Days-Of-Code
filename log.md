### Day 1: 1/2/2019

**Today's Progress:**
Checked out how to make a HTML5 Canvas from JS30. Also experimented with building a 'MegaMenu' at work.

**Thoughts:**
Even though it is unlikely that I would need to build or use a canvas it was cool seeing how to build one with JS.
Did not fully figure out how to get the MegaMenu working specifically based on the design, but on the right path.  MUI-Tooltip didn't seem like a great option either
since it would require adjustments to the existing styles.
