# #301DaysOfCode - Log
The daily log of my **#301DaysOfCode** challenge.

## Log

### Day 1: 1/2/2019

**Today's Progress:**
Checked out how to make a HTML5 Canvas from JS30. Also experimented with building a 'MegaMenu' at work.

**Thoughts:**
Even though it is unlikely that I would need to build or use a canvas it was cool seeing how to build one with JS.
Did not fully figure out how to get the MegaMenu working specifically based on the design, but on the right path.  MUI-Tooltip didn't seem like a great option either
since it would require adjustments to the existing styles.

### Day 1: 1/3/2019

**Today's Progress:**
Learned how to select multiple checkboxes using shift click with JS30.  Going through CS50 Week 1 lecture learning C. some of the basics of programming: data types, operators, conditional statements and loops.

**Thoughts:**
Learning how to select multiple checkboxes using shift can be used in real world applications. I notice a lot of similarity between C and JS.

### Day 1: 1/4/2019

**Today's Progress:**
Continued to watch CS50 Lecture part 2. Learning more basics of C. Data types, loops, conditions / logic, theory.

**Thoughts:**
Even though I dont have much experience with different programming languages I enjoy how explicit C can be with data types.

### Day 1: 1/5/2019

**Today's Progress:**
Finished week 1 CS50 Lecture. Different ways of solving a problem. Introduces Cryptography - > Inputs / Key => Output (writing software that crypts and decrypts).  

**Thoughts:**
Taking in a password (that is hashed) or taking a message (input) and manipulating to cypher text (output).
